# Task1
This project is a personal portfolio landing page built using HTML and CSS. It features a responsive layout with a navigation bar, hero section with name and contact details, and sections for About Me, Skills, Projects, Education, Certifications, and Resume. The design uses Flexbox and media queries for responsiveness on smaller screens. A call-to-action resume download link and a clean footer with a thank-you message are included. This page was created and tested using VS Code with Live Server.
